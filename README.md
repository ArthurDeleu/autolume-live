# Autolume

Autolume-Live is a tool for real-time visual performances using StyleGAN2.

For detailed documentation and demos look at the [Metacreation Lab Website](https://www.metacreation.net/autolume).

## Getting started
### Ubuntu Autolume Installer Guide
To successfully run this program, your system must have a 64-bit Linux operating system, and you must download and install the following prerequisites:
- [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

#### Installation Steps

1. Open a terminal.
2. Clone this repository using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone -b git@github.com:Metacreation-Lab/autolume.git
   ```
3. `cd` into the cloned repository
4. Run the installer with `sh installer.sh`

#### Adding ffmpeg

1. Update and upgrade the system packages to get the ffmpeg version currently available in the repository. Execute the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
   ```
2. After upgrading the repository, install ffmpeg by running the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install ffmpeg
   ```
3. Confirm that ffmpeg has been installed with:
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -version
   ```

### Windows Autolume Installer Guide

To successfully run this program, your system must have a 64-bit Windows (Windows 10 & 11 compatible) operating system, and you must download and install the following prerequisites:

- **[Autolume Installer](sinstaller.ps1)**
- **[Cuda-Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-7-0-download-archive)**
- **[Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)** (scroll down to files and select a compatible version to your system)

*While installing Python, make sure to select "Add Python to PATH" as shown below:*

#### Installation Steps

1. Open Command Prompt (`windows+R` > `cmd`)
2. Run the following command: `where python`
   - Ctrl+C the result. It should look like this:
     ```
     C:\Users\Metacreation Lab>where python
     C:\Users\Metacreation Lab\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe
     C:\Users\Metacreation Lab\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\python.exe
     ```
   - If more than one result is thrown, copy Python 3.10.

3. Click on the `sinstaller.ps1` file and open it (located in your Downloads folder).
4. Paste the outcome of step 2 to the `systemPython` variable under `#Define python path` in the script:
   ```powershell
   # Define python path
   $systemPython = "C:\Users\Metacreation Lab\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe"
   ```

5. If this is the first time running a script in Windows, you have to enable that functionality first. Detailed instructions to do so, can be found **[here](https://medium.com/@dfarkhod/how-to-enable-powershell-script-execution-in-windows-10-49f2b182649d)**

6. Go to Downloads and type PowerShell in the address bar and hit Enter.
7. Run the following command inside PowerShell: `.\sinstaller.ps1`
8. Next time you want to run Autolume, simply click the AutolumeLiveColab shortcut on your Desktop.

Place your StyleGAN2 checkpoints (https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2-ada-pytorch) in the `models` folder.
Click the AutolumeLiveColab desktop shortcut and get going!
